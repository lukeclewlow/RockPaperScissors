# Rock, Paper, Scissors

The challenge is to build a basic web-app for the classic game.

 * I will be building the game engine in Ruby using RSpec for testing and implenting this using Sinatra with Cucumber for testing.

 The conditions that need to be implemented in the game are:

 	- the player has to enter their name before the game
	- the player will be presented the choices (rock, paper and scissors)
	- the player can choose one option
	- the game will choose a random option
	- a winner will be declared
